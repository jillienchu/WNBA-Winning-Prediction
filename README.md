# WNBA - Winning Team Prediction and Player Analysis

## :pushpin: Abstract
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a team winning, analyzes the impact of a player's overall match statistics on their future efficiency and the impact of a team's overall statistics on a team winning the game. The WNBA 2014 data set used for this analysis can be found here: [https://sports-statistics.com/sports-data/sports-data-sets-for-data-modeling-visualization-predictions-machine-learning/](https://sports-statistics.com/sports-data/sports-data-sets-for-data-modeling-visualization-predictions-machine-learning/)

## :bulb: Features

* tidyverse
* ggplot2
* corrplot
* ggpubr
* dplyr
* car
* pROC
* caret
* AICcmodavg
